1. Suppose that you have only have access to a routine that produces samples U from the Uniform [0, 1] distribution. Most packages used for statistical computing, such as R or MATLAB have access to such a routine. 
(a) Write a program that uses the inversion method to sample from a Binomial (10, 1/3) distribution. Run the program and plot a histogram of 1, 000 samples. Recall that here you will need to make use of the pseudo-inverse of the cumulative distribution function.

Solution:
To sample from Binomial (n, p) distribution using inversion method we need to consider CDF of binomial distribution. The CDF is:

```math

F( x ) = P( X \leq x ) = \sum_{i=0}^x {n \\choose i} p^i q^(n-i)
```
For a given Uniform random sample U ~ Uniform (0,1)  and transforming it using the inverse of the CDF of binomial dstribution. We simulate U and find the smallest x such that the cumulative probability P( X ≤ x ) is greater than or equal to U. \n

**The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**

```math
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
